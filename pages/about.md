## About the Collection

Through readings of descriptions of Niagara Falls in documents like Peck's Tourist Companion (available through Brock Library Archives), Niagara Falls was marketed to tourists as a location of natural beauty and wonder, that all travelers must see to experience. 

In the summer, Niagara Falls was upheld as a spot of beauty, and offered various destinations to view the falls, or falls-specific phenomena, like circular rainbows. Locations like Goat's Island, Prospect Point, and the Whirlwind Rapids, were advertised as limited opportunities to see exclusive vantage points of the falls.

In the winter, when the Falls would freeze over, the spectacle of walking, skiing, or even boarding on the metre's thick ice was the draw for tourists, despite it's nearly 0 degree average temperature.

This collection is a selection of advertisements, photo-op's of Niagara Falls, as well as the typical visitors that were expected, advertised to, and catered to. The indigenous peoples of the Falls, the Haudenosaunee, and Cree tribes, were subjugated, only allowed to be in view of the white colonist tourists if it was advertised as an "Indian Excursion", as is seen in the descriptions of the Falls' events. The purpose of this collection is to show what Niagara Falls chose to represent itself as, in order to establish itself as a must-see tourist destination in the 19th century, as well as what they felt made their landmark special.
